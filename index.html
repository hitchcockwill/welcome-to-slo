              Try your best to put a name to a face.But you'll be meeting so many people, don't be embarrassed if you have to ask them their name again. Get dinner with as many people as you can the first night: roll deep.

        <h3>College Party Etiquette</h3>
        <p>This isn&rsquo;t Billy&rsquo;s house when his parents are out of town.  You won&rsquo;t know everyone at the party anymore.  Here are a couple rules of thumb for partying at someone else&rsquo;s house:
        </p>
        <ul class="lt-2">
          <li>
            <span>
              <h5>What you <em class="no">might</em> be thinking</h5>
              &ldquo;Hey, I really need another iPod and that one is just sitting there!&rdquo;
            </span>
            <span>
              <h5>What you <em class="yes">should</em> be thinking</h5>
              &ldquo;That guy is just as poor as me, maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t jack his iPod.&rdquo;
            </span>
          </li>
          <div class="clearfloat"></div>
          <li>
            <span>
              <h5>What you <em class="no">might</em> be thinking</h5>
              &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk outside this house until we figure out where we&rsquo;re going next&rdquo;
            </span>
            <span>
              <h5>What you <em class="yes">should</em> be thinking</h5>
              &ldquo;We should figure out where were going next in this house and then leave. Let&rsquo;s not linger outside.&rdquo;
            </span>
          </li>
          <div class="clearfloat"></div>
          <li>
            <span>
              <h5>What you <em class="no">might</em> be thinking</h5>
              &ldquo;That bottle of Patron looks delicious, and we are WOWies, so it must be for us.&rdquo;
            </span>
            <span>
              <h5>What you <em class="yes">should</em> be thinking</h5>
              &ldquo;That really expensive bottle of tequila is probably someone elses and I shouldn&rsquo;t drink it.  But this plastic bottle of Heritage is for the public, but it&rsquo;s always good to ask.&rdquo;
            </span>
          </li>
          <div class="clearfloat"></div>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve read some scenarios, be aware that that party host is letting you into their home, (and usually purchased alcohol for public consumption.) Keep that in mind when you are at their house.</p>
        <ul class="lt-1">
          <li>
            <h5 class="listNumber">1</h5>
            <span>
              <h5>Don&rsquo;t steal stuff</h5>
              This should go without saying, but it's worth mentioning. Very few people have the money to buy a new iPod or laptop. 
              </span>
          </li>
          <div class="clearfloat"></div>

            <h5 class="listNumber">2</h5>
            <span>
              <h5>Don&rsquo;t go in the fridge looking for chaser</h5>
              Stop being a pussy, take the shot, and don&rsquo;t take the host&rsquo;s unopened bottle of orange juice. He needs it for his hangover tomorrow anyways.
              </span>
          </li>
           <div class="clearfloat"></div>
          <li>
            <h5 class="listNumber">3</h5>
            <span>
              <h5>Ever cleaned up after a party?</h5>
              If you haven&rsquo;t you will at some point during college. So if you do a huge spill, try to clean it up.  And that gum your chewing? Spit it into a trashcan or outside.
              </span>
          </li>
          <div class="clearfloat"></div>
          <li>
            <h5 class="listNumber">4</h5>
            <span>
              <h5>Kegs and plastic bottle vodka are your beacons of hope</h5>
              These are usually for the public to enjoy.
              </span>

            <h5 class="listNumber">5</h5>
            <span>
              <h5>Extra credit!</h5>
              If you can find the host, tell him thanks for having you and how stoked you are for the next four years.  It might make his night (and he might show you where the good tasting beverages are).

        <h3>How to avoid getting arrested during WoW week</h3>
        <p>University Police (UPD) steps up enforcement during WOW Week.  Yes, they are real cops.  They will be patrolling the main streets surrounding campus looking for WOWies not acting responsibly.  Here are a couple tips to help you avoid a run in with the 5-O.
        </p>
        <ul class="lt-1">
          <li><h5 class="listNumber">1</h5><span><h5>Don&rsquo;t carry a red cup (or any beverage) on the street.</h5>This is literally like 	strapping a flashing beacon on you asking for a ticket. Not only will you get slapped with a minor in possession, the cop will make you pour out the drink (and in 	this economy, no one can afford that).</span></li>
          <div class="clearfloat"></div>
          <li><h5 class="listNumber">2</h5><span><h5>Control your bladder until you arrive at your next location</h5>You learned this 	after you stopped wearing diapers, so you know you can hold it. It’s hard to run from the police with your pants around you ankles, so empty your tank in a real bathroom (or a really, really isolated bush somewhere).</span></li>
          <div class="clearfloat"></div>
          <li><h5 class="listNumber">3</h5><span><h5>It&rsquo;s all about the wolfpack.</h5>Try to avoid walking around alone.UPD will usually not bother stopping large groups. They&rsquo;re looking for some swerving, blacked out straggler walking in the middle of the street. This one is especially important for the ladies, because remember: &ldquo;safety in numbers.&rdquo;<br/><br/>We said wolfpack, not stampeding herd: Try to avoid rolling with all three levels of
          your tower to one party. During the first week, it is acceptable to arrive at parties in a
          fairly large group, but coming 100 strong probably won&rsquo;t get you in.</span></li>
          <div class="clearfloat"></div>
          <li><h5 class="listNumber">4</h5><span><h5>Don&rsquo;t &lsquo;win&rsquo; the Triple Crown</h5>I know, it sounds really cool, but you don&rsquo;t want this. Don&rsquo;t get caught urinating in public, blacked out, with a drink in your hand. You&rsquo;ll earn yourself a hefty ticket and a night in the slammer.</span></li>
          <div class="clearfloat"></div>
          <li><h5 class="listNumber">5</h5><span><h5>Cool your jets Chuck Lidell</h5>That guy talking shit across the street is probably just blacked out anyways (or a douche). Move on and be the bigger man and don&rsquo;t yell anything back. You probably can&rsquo;t fight that well and everyone&rsquo;s going to think you&rsquo;re the douche (and people sue for everything nowadays anyway).</span></li>

        <h3>How to avoid getting kicked out of the dorms in your first few weeks</h3>
        <p>A couple unfortunate freshman get the boot from their dorm in the first two weeks.  Don&rsquo;t be this person, because not only will it ruin all your prospective dorm memories, mom and dad won&rsquo;t be too excited about paying for the entire year&rsquo;s dorm fees.</p>
        <ul class="lt-1">
          <li>
            <h5 class="listNumber">1</h5>
            <span>
              <h5>Don&rsquo;t play beerpong on the closet doors</h5>
              It seems like a really good idea at the time, but be aware that the walls are paper thin and your R.A. can hear a pin drop. The odds are not in your favor that he won&rsquo;t hear you clinking that ping pong ball off that play button rack.

              <h5>It&rsquo;s one big bathroom</h5>
              Be aware that everyone&rsquo;s going to hear you yacking in a bathroom stall, including the R.A.

            <span>
              <h5>Smoking trees in your room is a really bad idea</h5>
              That person knocking on your door isn&rsquo;t your RA, it&rsquo;s UPD. The only way out is the window (not advised). Good luck. If you want to spark it up with your new buddies, check out the Cal Poly "P" or the Poly Canyon architecture graveyard.

        <h3>Where do I go to find parties in SLO?</h3>
        <p>Many streets surrounding Cal Poly are occupied by a majority of college students. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, some families decided to live on these streets too. The main street for parties is Hathaway, and there are many other streets in close proximity to it.These other streets include: Orange, Kentucky, Slack, Foothill, Fredericks, and Bond. Some parties on these streets will be closed to the public, while others will embrace all WOWies. If you are looking for a party, this is a good place to start. Also, check out the map.
